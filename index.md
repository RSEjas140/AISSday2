This contains all the day two content for the AI Summer School. We will complete our introduction to Python via the IDE Spyder. Day 2 focuses on cleaning and manipulating data. It is expected that your dataset may start to take you in a specific direction.

**By the end of day two, we hope you will be confident to:**

* Use Pandas to manipulate dataframes
* Visualise your data.
* Understand how to deal with noisey/dirty data

**By the end of day two, we hope you will have discovered:**
* The question you want to try and answer
* Data structures, packages, and data types that are relevent to your datasset/problem.


FAQ sessions: demonstrators/attendees email jas140@aber.ac.uk with any good, common, or difficult questions and we will collate and answer periodically.
