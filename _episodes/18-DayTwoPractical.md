### Set up a new project.
Create a new project and a new script. Add a data folder to the project and place your dataset in this folder. Set the data folder to read-only.

### Consider the type of data in your dataset.

Understanding the data types in your dataset is crucial for effective processing and analysis.

Consider:

1. What kind of data am I dealing with?
2. What types are in my data?
3. Have I seen an example that relates to my data?
4. What libraries will I need?
5. What am I unsure about with my dataset?

### What import method will I use?

The method of importing data into Python depends on the data format and source. You may have a very common file type (e.g., CSV Files) or something much more unusual that may need an approach we have not covered.

### How am I going to store my data in Python?

Choosing the appropriate data structure for handling your dataset can greatly influence your workflow.

1. What functionality do I need?
2. How does my data type influence the way I store it?
3. How will it affect run-time?

### Tips for when you start writting code

1. Start by writing notes (#) detailing your workflow.
2. Don’t try to write everything in one go. Write and verify as you go.
3. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.

### Recap & reflect

Consider the material we have covered today:

1. Are all the concepts clear?
2. Are there any additional tools you feel you need?
3. Which section did you find the most difficult?
4. What content might you need more support with?
5. Do I have a clearer understanding of the problem you want to solve?

### Stretch Tasks (if you finish before the allotted time)

1. Try visualising interesting aspects of your dataset.
2. Collate statistics about your dataset.
