title: "Practical session Day 2"
teaching: 10
exercises: 50
questions:
- "Can you start to clean your dataset?"
objectives:
- "Visualise your data to understand its distribution"
- "Identify issues (e.g., missing values, duplicates, outliers, etc.)"
- "Consider what can you do about your missing values"
- "Determine what you aim to achieve with the cleaning process (e.g., improve accuracy, consistency, completeness)."
- "Can you validate aspects of your data?"
keypoints:
- "The reliability of your analysis relies on the cleanliness of your data"

### Continue using the project you set up to get your data into Python.
Add a processed data folder to the project if you need one.

### Cleaning Techniques.

Understanding the data types in your dataset is crucial for effective processing and analysis.

Consider:

1. Data Imputation: Decide on methods for filling in missing values (e.g., mean imputation, interpolation).
2. Normalization/Standardization: Apply techniques to normalize or standardize data values for consistency.
3. Data Transformation: Perform necessary transformations (e.g., converting data types, aggregating data).
4. Error Correction: Implement methods to correct detected errors.


### Document the process

Keep a record of what you have done so when you come back to it you can easily appricate what you did to change your data.

### Sanity tests.

When you have applied some cleaning, how are you going to test that it has been done correctly?

### Save your new cleaned dataset

Keep it as a seperate file and do not write over the original.

### Tips for when you start writting code to clean your data

1. Start by writing notes (#) detailing your workflow.
2. Don’t try to write everything in one go. Write and verify as you go.
3. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.

### Recap & reflect

Consider the material we have covered today:

1. Are all the concepts clear?
2. Are there any additional tools you feel you need?
3. Which section did you find the most difficult?
4. What content might you need more support with?
5. Do I have a clearer understanding of the problem you want to solve?

### Stretch Tasks (if you finish before the allotted time)

1. Consider what machine learning methods you want to use on your dataset.
2. Spend some time finalising the problem you are trying to solve in your dataset.
